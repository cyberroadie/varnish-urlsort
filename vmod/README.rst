SYNOPSIS
========

import example;

DESCRIPTION
===========

Example Varnish vmod demonstrating how to write an out-of-tree Varnish vmod.

Implements the traditional Hello World as a vmod.

FUNCTIONS
=========

hello
-----

Prototype
        ::

                hello(STRING S)
Return value
	STRING
Description
	Returns "Hello, " prepended to S
Example
        ::

                set resp.http.hello = example.hello("World");

INSTALLATION
============

This is an example skeleton for developing out-of-tree Varnish
vmods. It implements the "Hello, World!" as a vmod callback. Not
particularly useful in good hello world tradition, but demonstrates how
to get the glue around a vmod working.

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Usage::

 ./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the `VARNISHSRC` and `VARNISHSRC/include`
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod
* make install - installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``

In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines::
        
        import example;

        sub vcl_deliver {
                # This sets resp.http.hello to "Hello, World"
                set resp.http.hello = example.hello("World");
        }
